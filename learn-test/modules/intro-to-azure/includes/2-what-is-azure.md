Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. But before we go further, let's define briefly what cloud computing is.

## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the Internet using a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. Put another way, it's a way to rent compute power and storage from someone else's data center.

Instead of maintaining CPUs and storage in your data center, you rent them for the time that you need them. You can treat cloud resources like you would your resources in your own data center. When you're done using them, you just give them back. You're billed only for what you use.

While this is all great, the real value of the cloud is that it enables you to quickly solve your toughest business challenges and bring cutting edge solutions to your users.

## What can I do on Azure?

Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.

Many teams start by moving their existing applications to virtual machines that run in the cloud. Although migrating your existing apps to VMs is a great start, the cloud is more than just "a different place to run your VMs".

For example, Azure provides AI and machine-learning services that can naturally communicate with your users through vision, hearing, and speech. It also provides storage solutions that can grow and shrink to accommodate massive amounts of data.These are simply not feasible without the power of the cloud.

Rather than laying cable and racking servers, you can use Azure as an efficient and low-cost way to let your team explore new ideas. Thousands of innovations are driven by experimentation on Azure.

## Summary

Cloud computing enables you to rent compute power and storage instead of buying physical assets such as CPUs and storage. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform, and it provides many kinds of services that go well beyond what you can do with commodity hardware.
